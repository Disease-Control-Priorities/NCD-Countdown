# NCD-Countdown

Code for the NCD Countdown paper can be found in the folder titled ‘new_demography’. 
The scripts are numbered in the order they are to be run. 
Anything with the extension ‘_parallel’ was run on a high-performance computer utilizing multi-threaded programming to parallelize the code for the 123 country-specific runs.

Required data for the code can be found in the ‘new_inputs’ folder. 
Due to space constraints some of the original source data are not hosted online but can be requested from the corresponding author. 
*Note that the processed input data are stored as .Rda files and will allow users to run the code as is.
